This scene generates a mesh of your surroundings and shows how to use TriPlaner projection in a shader in order to texture the mesh.
You can swap out the ceiling, ground and wall texture on the Triplaner material with any other texture you would like.
e.g. grass, rocks and dirt in order to make the world look like a cave.

Tri Planer projection uses world space texture coordinates and allows you to tile a particular texture across the mesh.

The sample also sets the meshing distance to 40 meters and the voxel size to 0.05m in order to demonstrate long range meshing.
If you are using an iPhone Pro you will need to make sure you have turned off "prefer lidar if available" in order to see long distance meshing in action.

<b>Instructions</b>:

Just move your camera around, and you will see a mesh forming over everything in the scene.
