In this example, we'll use the Coverage API to select a wayspot that you can localize to.

<b>Instructions</b>
Add your API key in the Lightship>Settings menu.
(Remote) uncheck the <b>use current location </b> button and enter the lat long of the place you'd like to test.
(Local) Set a radius and tap <b>Request Areas</b>
Choose a wayspot and tap the <i>Localize</i> button.
Physically go to the location youâ€™ve chosen and point the camera towards it.
After a few seconds you should see the "Tracking" message and a cube spawn at the wayspot origin.
